# Alien Dash Game
A python gaming script that responds to user input and thus allows them to play a 2D "Infinite Runner Game" with an alien sprite attempting to avoid "slime" and "fly" obstacles. This project was created using python and pygame.

  I decided to create this personal project at the conclusion of my Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science(CSCI 1103) course at Bowdoin College, where I learned basic python programming skills(everything from variables and functions to Object Oriented Programming and matplotlib).
  As a person who has played runner games all through my life, like Subway Surfers and Jetpack Joyride, I found that making a videogame using python would be a great way to combine my newly learned coding skills with my love for videogames.

This project took me a week, and during this time frame I learned a lot about pygame, which was mainly responsible for the user interface.
In Pygame, I learned how to:
  - Set up a basic pygame game window
  - display and animate images using files
  - Play music and sound effects
  - Detect user input(Key press, mouse movement, etc.)
  - Use the Clock class to achieve desired player and enemy logic and calculate scores
  - Use the sprite class to more easily manipulate connected surfaces and rectangles

The python skills I utilized include:
- Control Flow and Logic: To control the progression of the game, handle events, and change game states
- Random Module to generate obstacle sprites
- Functions and Object Oriented Programming(OOP) to better organize the 240 lines of code



**How to Play the Game**
1. Install pygame by opening the terminal window and typing in: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
2. Download the necessary project file I included that contains all of the images and files used
3. Press Space to jump over any slime obstacles coming at the Alien Sprite and stay still to avoid the flying fly obstacles


**Future Ideas**
  I hope to implement a ducking feature, where the sprite can duck under the fly. I attempted to do this already, but it caused a glitch where the sprite went below the ground floor that I set. In the future I hope to solve this issue.
  Currently, I am working on a Squid Game inspired Glass Bridges game, using pygame and python again. This game will a 2x20 row of identical squares, with one square in the row being safe to stand on and the other not being safe to stand on. The user will have 7 attempts to correctly jump their way across the bridge without breaking the glass underneath it.




**Credits**
  As this is my first personal project and first time learning pygame, I followed the tutorial linked below to create this project and also added my own touches to the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
